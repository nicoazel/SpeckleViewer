## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8888 (8080 is taken by the local speckle server instance ðŸ’¯)
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
## Deployment

You will need to modify the ./dist/config.js file to fit your deployment details. Itâ€™s rather self-descriptive, it just exports a global object with info:

```
var SpkAppConfig = {
  serverUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  allowGuestAccess: true,
  logoUrl: 'https://company.png'
}

window.SpkAppConfig = SpkAppConfig
```
Itâ€™s rather important to serve things to ```https``` and make sure the server is allowing ```cors```.

## Adding Streams Once Running

To add more streams, just add more stream ids to the url, separated by commas:
 ```https://s003.speckle.works/view/?ryuFyiHuz,rkf6JoHuf```
